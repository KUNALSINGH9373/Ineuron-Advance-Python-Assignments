    "**Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception processing is a crucial aspect of software development that\n",
    "involves handling unexpected or exceptional situations that can occur\n",
    "during program execution. Here are three common applications for\n",
    "exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Error Handling**: Exception processing is primarily used for error\n",
    "    > handling within software applications. When a program encounters\n",
    "    > an error, such as a division by zero, file not found, or invalid\n",
    "    > input, it raises an exception. Exception handling mechanisms allow\n",
    "    > developers to gracefully capture and manage these errors,\n",
    "    > preventing the application from crashing and providing meaningful\n",
    "    > error messages to users. This ensures that the application can\n",
    "    > recover from errors or at least handle them gracefully without\n",
    "    > causing data loss or instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Resource Management**: Exception processing is essential for\n",
    "    > managing resources like files, database connections, network\n",
    "    > sockets, or hardware devices. When working with these resources,\n",
    "    > exceptions can occur due to issues such as file locks, connection\n",
    "    > timeouts, or hardware failures. Exception handling allows\n",
    "    > developers to release or clean up these resources properly when\n",
    "    > exceptions occur, ensuring that system resources are used\n",
    "    > efficiently and that the application remains robust even in the\n",
    "    > face of resource-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Custom Exception Handling**: Developers often use custom\n",
    "    > exceptions to represent specific exceptional conditions within\n",
    "    > their applications. For example, in a financial application, you\n",
    "    > might define custom exceptions for insufficient funds or invalid\n",
    "    > transaction amounts. Custom exception processing enables\n",
    "    > developers to handle these domain-specific exceptions\n",
    "    > appropriately, making the code more readable and maintainable. By\n",
    "    > creating custom exceptions and handling them separately, you can\n",
    "    > implement specific logic to address the unique requirements of\n",
    "    > your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an\n",
    "exception?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following things could happen if you donâ€™t do something extra to treat\n",
    "an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Uncaught Exception**: In many programming languages, an unhandled\n",
    "    > exception will result in the termination of the program or\n",
    "    > application. This means that when an exception occurs and is not\n",
    "    > caught or handled by appropriate code, the program will typically\n",
    "    > stop executing abruptly. This can lead to a crash or unexpected\n",
    "    > program termination, which is often not desirable, especially in\n",
    "    > production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Incomplete Operations**: If an exception is raised during the\n",
    "    > execution of a particular operation, and it's not properly\n",
    "    > handled, the operation might remain incomplete or inconsistent.\n",
    "    > For example, if you're updating a database and an exception occurs\n",
    "    > midway through the update process, without proper exception\n",
    "    > handling, the database might end up in an inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Resource Leaks**: Failing to handle exceptions that occur when\n",
    "    > working with resources like files, network connections, or\n",
    "    > database connections can lead to resource leaks. Without proper\n",
    "    > cleanup or resource release in an exception scenario, these\n",
    "    > resources may not be released, leading to potential resource\n",
    "    > exhaustion or issues in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Lack of Error Reporting**: When exceptions are not handled, the\n",
    "    > error information may not be logged or reported. This makes it\n",
    "    > challenging to diagnose and fix issues in the software. Proper\n",
    "    > exception handling allows you to log error details, generate\n",
    "    > meaningful error messages, and notify developers or system\n",
    "    > administrators about problems in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your\n",
    "script?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Try-Catch (or Try-Except) Blocks**: Most programming languages\n",
    "    > provide a mechanism for catching and handling exceptions using\n",
    "    > try-catch (or try-except) blocks. You enclose the code that might\n",
    "    > raise an exception within a try block, and you specify how to\n",
    "    > handle the exception in a catch (or except) block. This allows you\n",
    "    > to gracefully handle the exception, take corrective action, or\n",
    "    > provide meaningful error messages to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Throwing a Different Exception**: In some cases, you may want to\n",
    "    > catch an exception, perform some additional logic, and then throw\n",
    "    > a different exception to indicate a higher-level problem or\n",
    "    > provide more context. This can be useful for translating low-level\n",
    "    > exceptions into higher-level, more informative exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Retry Logic**: Depending on the nature of the exception, you can\n",
    "    > implement retry logic to attempt the operation again. For example,\n",
    "    > if an exception occurs due to a network timeout, you might retry\n",
    "    > the network operation a certain number of times before giving up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Using the throw Statement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In many programming languages, you can use the throw statement to\n",
    "explicitly raise an exception. The throw statement typically requires an\n",
    "exception object or error message as an argument. When executed, it\n",
    "causes an exception to be thrown, and the program will search for an\n",
    "appropriate exception handler to process it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Invoking Functions or Methods that Raise Exceptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many standard library functions or methods may raise exceptions under\n",
    "certain conditions. By calling these functions or methods, you can\n",
    "indirectly trigger exceptions. For example, attempting to open a file\n",
    "that doesn't exist can raise a FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at\n",
    "termination time, regardless of whether or not an exception exists.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The finally Block**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages provide a finally block that allows you to\n",
    "define a set of statements that will always be executed, regardless of\n",
    "whether an exception occurs within a try block. This is often used for\n",
    "resource cleanup and ensuring that critical actions are performed before\n",
    "the program exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **Using Resource Management Techniques**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the finally block, you can use resource management\n",
    "techniques like the using statement in C# or the with statement in\n",
    "Python (for context managers) to ensure that resources are properly\n",
    "released, even in the presence of exceptions.\n",
