    "\n",
    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide\n",
    "a programming paradigm that facilitates the organization and management\n",
    "of code in a way that reflects real-world objects and their\n",
    "interactions. OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects, which are\n",
    "instances of classes, to model and represent data and behaviour in a\n",
    "program. Here are some key purposes of OOP in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Abstraction**: OOP allows you to abstract complex systems by\n",
    "    > modelling them as objects with well-defined attributes (data) and\n",
    "    > methods (functions). This abstraction simplifies the design and\n",
    "    > makes it easier to manage and understand complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and\n",
    "    > the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a\n",
    "    > class. This provides data hiding, where the internal state of an\n",
    "    > object is hidden from external access unless explicitly allowed by\n",
    "    > the class through methods. This helps in maintaining data\n",
    "    > integrity and reduces unintended interference with object\n",
    "    > internals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows you to create new classes (child\n",
    "    > classes or subclasses) based on existing classes (parent classes\n",
    "    > or super classes). This promotes code reuse and the creation of\n",
    "    > hierarchical relationships between classes, enabling the sharing\n",
    "    > of common attributes and behaviours while allowing for\n",
    "    > specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes\n",
    "    > to be treated as objects of a common base class. This enables you\n",
    "    > to write more generic and flexible code, as you can work with\n",
    "    > objects based on their common interfaces or behaviors, rather than\n",
    "    > their specific implementations. Polymorphism is often achieved\n",
    "    > through method overriding and interfaces (in the case of abstract\n",
    "    > classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Modularity and Reusability**: OOP promotes modularity by\n",
    "    > encapsulating related functionality within classes. These classes\n",
    "    > can be reused in different parts of a program or even in different\n",
    "    > programs, promoting code reusability and reducing code\n",
    "    > duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when you access an attribute (a method or a variable) of an\n",
    "object, the inheritance search looks for that attribute in the following\n",
    "order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Instance**: It first checks if the attribute is present in the\n",
    "    > instance itself. If the attribute is found in the instance, it is\n",
    "    > used, and the search stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Class**: If the attribute is not found in the instance, Python\n",
    "    > then looks for it in the class of the instance. This is where the\n",
    "    > concept of inheritance comes into play. If the attribute is found\n",
    "    > in the class, it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Super classes (Base Classes)**: If the attribute is not found in\n",
    "    > the class, Python continues to search in the superclass or base\n",
    "    > class of the class, if there is one. This process continues up the\n",
    "    > inheritance chain until the attribute is found or until Python\n",
    "    > reaches the top-level base class, which is usually the built-in\n",
    "    > object class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Global Namespace**: If the attribute is not found in any of the\n",
    "    > above locations, Python will finally search in the global\n",
    "    > namespace. This is the outermost scope where global variables and\n",
    "    > functions are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance\n",
    "object?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Object**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A class object is the blueprint or template for creating instances\n",
    "    > of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is created when you define a class using the class keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It defines the structure and behaviour of instances that belong to\n",
    "    > that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Class objects can have class-level attributes and methods, which are\n",
    "    > shared among all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Class objects are typically used for defining the common\n",
    "    > characteristics and behaviours that instances of the class will\n",
    "    > share.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance Object**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   An instance object is a concrete, individual object created from a\n",
    "    > class.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is created by calling the class as if it were a function (the\n",
    "    > class constructor) or by using other methods such as factory\n",
    "    > methods or copy constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each instance has its own set of attributes and can have unique data\n",
    "    > values that differ from other instances of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Instance objects represent specific instances or objects with\n",
    "    > distinct characteristics and states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the first argument in a class's method function is\n",
    "conventionally named **self**, although you can technically choose any\n",
    "name for it (though it's strongly recommended to stick with **self** for\n",
    "clarity and consistency). This first argument is special and serves a\n",
    "crucial purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Reference to the Instance**: The **self** parameter is used to\n",
    "    > reference the instance of the class on which the method is called.\n",
    "    > It essentially binds the method to the instance, allowing the\n",
    "    > method to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and call\n",
    "    > other methods defined within the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Accessing Instance Variables**: By using self, you can access and\n",
    "    > modify instance variables (attributes) within the method. This\n",
    "    > allows you to work with the specific data associated with the\n",
    "    > instance calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Method Calls**: When you call a method on an instance, Python\n",
    "    > automatically passes the instance itself as the **self** argument,\n",
    "    > so you don't need to provide it explicitly. This is why you\n",
    "    > typically see method calls like obj.method(), and self is not\n",
    "    > specified during the call.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Instance-specific Operations**: Methods defined within a class\n",
    "    > often perform operations that are specific to the instance calling\n",
    "    > the method. self allows you to differentiate between different\n",
    "    > instances of the same class and apply operations accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method, also known as the constructor method, serves a\n",
    "specific and important purpose in Python classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization**: The primary purpose of the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method\n",
    "    > is to initialize the attributes (instance variables) of an object\n",
    "    > when it is created from a class. It allows you to set the initial\n",
    "    > state or values of an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Constructor**: It acts as a constructor for instances of the\n",
    "    > class. When you create an instance of a class, Python\n",
    "    > automatically calls the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method to perform any\n",
    "    > necessary setup for that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Passing Arguments**: The \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method can accept arguments\n",
    "    > that are used to initialize the attributes of the instance. This\n",
    "    > allows you to customize the initial state of each object created\n",
    "    > from the classs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Instance-Specific Initialization**: Since \\_\\_init\\_\\_ is called\n",
    "    > when an instance is created, it can perform instance-specific\n",
    "    > initialization tasks. This means you can initialize attributes\n",
    "    > differently for each\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Define a Class**: First, you need to define a class that serves as\n",
    "a blueprint for creating instances. The class defines the attributes and\n",
    "methods that instances of the class will have. instance, tailoring them\n",
    "to the specific needs of that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **Instantiate the Class**: To create an instance of the class, you\n",
    "use the class name followed by parentheses, like calling a function.\n",
    "This calls the class's \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method to initialize the attributes\n",
    "and returns a new instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. **Optional: Access Attributes and Methods**: Once you have created\n",
    "an instance, you can access its attributes and call its methods using\n",
    "the dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. **Customize Initialization**: If the class's \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method\n",
    "accepts arguments, you can pass values to customize the initialization\n",
    "of each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. **Repeat as Needed**: You can create as many instances of the class\n",
    "as needed, each with its own set of attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Use the class Keyword**: Start by using the class keyword followed\n",
    "    by the name you want to give to your class. Class names typically\n",
    "    follow the CamelCase naming convention, which means the first letter\n",
    "    of each word in the name is capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Define Attributes**: Inside the class, you can define attributes,\n",
    "    which are variables that hold data associated with instances of the\n",
    "    class. These attributes can be thought of as the characteristics or\n",
    "    properties of the objects created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Define Methods**: Methods are functions defined within the class\n",
    "    that describe the behaviors or actions associated with the class.\n",
    "    Methods can access and manipulate the class's attributes and perform\n",
    "    various operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Constructor (\\_\\_init\\_\\_ method)**: Optionally, you can define an\n",
    "    \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method within the class to initialize the attributes\n",
    "    when instances of the class are created. The \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method is\n",
    "    a special method that is automatically called when you create a new\n",
    "    object from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Create Instances**: To create instances (objects) of the class,\n",
    "    you simply use the class name followed by parentheses, which is\n",
    "    similar to calling a function. This will call the \\_\\_init\\_\\_\n",
    "    method to initialize the instance's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Access Attributes and Call Methods**: Once you have created\n",
    "    instances, you can access their attributes and call their methods\n",
    "    using the dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can define the superclasses (also known as parent classes\n",
    "or base classes) of a class by specifying them in the class definition.\n",
    "Superclasses are classes from which a new class inherits attributes and\n",
    "methods. This is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming\n",
    "known as inheritance. Here's how you define superclasses for a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **ParentClass** is defined as a superclass or parent class. It\n",
    "    > serves as the base class from which other classes can inherit\n",
    "    > attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **ChildClass** is defined as a subclass or child class. It is\n",
    "    > inheriting from ParentClass by specifying ParentClass within\n",
    "    > parentheses after its own name in the class definition (class\n",
    "    > ChildClass(ParentClass)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've defined this relationship, ChildClass will inherit all the\n",
    "attributes and methods from ParentClass. This means that instances of\n",
    "ChildClass will have access to the attributes and methods of both\n",
    "ChildClass and ParentClass. You can also override or extend the behavior\n",
    "of inherited methods in the subclass if needed.\n",
    "\n",
