    "**Q1. What is the difference between \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ and\n",
    "\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the main difference between \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ and\n",
    "\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_ is that \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ is used when an attribute\n",
    "is not found. \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_ is used before looking at the actual\n",
    "attributes on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_ is called unconditionally when an attribute is\n",
    "being retrieved from an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ is called only when the attribute was not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a class also defines \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_(), the latter will not be called\n",
    "unless \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_() either calls it explicitly or raises an\n",
    "AttributeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "If \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_ needs to raise an AttributeError exception,\n",
    "nothing happens and \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ takes over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between properties and descriptors is that\n",
    "properties are a high-level application of descriptors. Descriptors are\n",
    "a low-level mechanism that lets you hook into an object's attributes\n",
    "being accessed. Properties are implemented using descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties are objects that have a getter, setter, and deleter method.\n",
    "The getter method is called when the property is accessed, the setter\n",
    "method is called when the property is set, and the deleter method is\n",
    "called when the property is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors are objects that implement the descriptor protocol. The\n",
    "descriptor protocol has three methods: \\_\\_get\\_\\_(), \\_\\_set\\_\\_(), and\n",
    "\\_\\_delete\\_\\_(). The \\_\\_get\\_\\_() method is called when the descriptor\n",
    "is accessed, the \\_\\_set\\_\\_() method is called when the descriptor is\n",
    "set, and the \\_\\_delete\\_\\_() method is called when the descriptor is\n",
    "deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties are a type of descriptor. When a property is assigned to an\n",
    "attribute, the property object becomes the descriptor for that\n",
    "attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between\n",
    "\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ and \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_, as well as properties and\n",
    "descriptors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_, \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_, properties, and descriptors are\n",
    "all mechanisms in Python used to control attribute access and behavior\n",
    "when working with objects. Each has its distinct functionality and use\n",
    "cases. Here are the key differences in functionality between these\n",
