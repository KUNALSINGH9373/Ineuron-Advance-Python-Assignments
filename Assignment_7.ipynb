    "**Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The try statement, commonly known as a \"try block\" or \"try-catch block\"\n",
    "in various programming languages, serves the purpose of managing\n",
    "exceptions or errors that may occur within a specific section of code.\n",
    "This construct allows developers to encapsulate code that could\n",
    "potentially raise exceptions and then handle those exceptions\n",
    "appropriately. The primary objectives of the try statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Handling: To create a structured approach to dealing with\n",
    "errors and exceptions that could disrupt the normal flow of a program.\n",
    "It prevents abrupt program termination by providing a mechanism to catch\n",
    "and address exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "The try statement typically includes one or more catch (or except)\n",
    "blocks following the try block. These catch blocks specify how to\n",
    "respond to specific types of exceptions that may be raised within the\n",
    "try block. Additionally, many programming languages support an optional\n",
    "finally block that contains code that will always execute, regardless of\n",
    "whether an exception was raised or not. This finally block is commonly\n",
    "used for cleanup or resource release tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What are the two most popular try statement variations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. try-catch (or try-except)**: This variation allows you to catch and\n",
    "handle specific exceptions that may occur within the try block. You can\n",
    "have multiple catch blocks, each associated with a different type of\n",
    "exception. When an exception occurs in the try block, the program will\n",
    "jump to the appropriate catch block based on the type of exception\n",
    "raised. This variation provides fine-grained control over how different\n",
    "types of exceptions are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **try-finally**: This variation combines the try block with a\n",
    "finally block. The finally block contains code that is guaranteed to\n",
    "execute, regardless of whether an exception was raised within the try\n",
    "block. It's often used for cleanup or resource release tasks. Even if an\n",
    "exception occurs, the finally block will still run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What is the purpose of the raise statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the raise statement in programming is to explicitly raise\n",
    "or throw an exception at a specific point within your code. When you use\n",
    "the raise statement, you indicate that a particular exceptional\n",
    "condition has occurred, and you initiate the process of propagating the\n",
    "exception up the call stack to find an appropriate exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it\n",
    "like?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The assert statement is used in programming to test if a given condition\n",
    "is true during program execution. It is often used as a debugging aid to\n",
    "catch programming errors early in development. If the condition\n",
    "specified in the assert statement evaluates to False, an AssertionError\n",
    "exception is raised, which typically results in the termination of the\n",
    "program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purposes of the assert statement are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Debugging**: It helps identify and locate issues in your code by\n",
    "    > verifying that certain conditions you expect to be true at\n",
    "    > specific points in your program are indeed true. If an assertion\n",
    "    > fails, it indicates a problem that requires investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Documentation**: assert statements can serve as a form of\n",
    "    > documentation, expressing the programmer's intent about certain\n",
    "    > conditions that should hold true at runtime. This makes the code\n",
    "    > more self-explanatory for both the original developer and others\n",
    "    > who may work on the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other\n",
    "statement is it like?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The with/as statement, often referred to as a \"context manager\" in many\n",
    "programming languages, is used for resource management, particularly to\n",
    "ensure that resources are properly acquired and released. It simplifies\n",
    "the management of resources, such as files, network connections, or\n",
    "database connections, by automatically taking care of setup and cleanup\n",
    "operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The with/as statement is similar in purpose to the try-finally\n",
    "statement, which is used for resource cleanup. However, the with/as\n",
    "statement offers a more concise and readable way to manage resources and\n",
    "is often preferred for situations where resource management is a primary\n",
    "concern.\n",
